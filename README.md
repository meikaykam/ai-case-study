* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
> Karthik Mahadevan was invited to a school for the blind in India to speak about design. When the students were asked about a problem they could solve, the answer was obvious they wanted to be more independent. They want to be able to perform day-to-day activities on their own.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
> Envision is a private company that has received funding through a pre-seed and seed round. In the seed round, they raised 1.5 million euros from seven investors.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
> They provide solutions for the blind and visually impaired to be more independent in accessing information in their surrounding area using their AI-powered app and smart glasses.


* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
> The blind and visually impaired. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
> Unlike their competitor, the OrCam3, Envision’s smart glasses offer a hands-free experience. Rather than using a handheld device to hover over a body of text, the user can tap the side of the smart glasses and prompt it to start scanning text within the camera’s view. 

> Ask Evision has ChatGPT integration to describe an image that the user took. It allows the user to interact with the glasses and ask questions.

> Envision also launched a new feature “Call an Aira agent”. The user can speak with a live person if the AI-powered solutions cannot assist with their request. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
> Envision’s smart glasses use facial recognition, and image recognition powered by ChatGPT to describe an image and read text in sixty languages. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
> Envision falls under assistive software technology. Their glasses use machine learning as an assistive tool for the blind and visually impaired

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
> ChatGPT and products like ChatGPT that use large language models. 

* What are the other major companies in this field?
> Some of the major companies are Meta’s smart glasses and Google Glass. Although Google shut down their Google Glass project twice, Envision partnered with Google Glass and integrated their AI-powered software with Google Glass’s upgraded hardware. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
> In 2023, Envision received 1.5 million euros in funding. The company used the funds to scale up and support its users globally. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
> How often do their users request an Aira agent?
> Out of their three Envision Glasses Edition, which one is most popular?  
> What are the top 5 features? 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
> Compared to other assistive smart glasses in the market, the cost to purchase Envision smart glasses ranges on the lower end compared to their competitors. Envision’s premium glasses are priced at $3499 while their competitors range between ?$2950 and $4995.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
> I suggest a street mode feature. The user would select that mode before crossing the street. The glasses will scan the surroundings for street lights and either emit a sound that it is safe to cross the street. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
> The goal of the product is to allow the user to be more independent. One of the biggest challenges I see with blind people is not knowing when to cross the street. I remember crossing a busy street in Chinatown, NY and a blind man was standing at the corner of the street next to me. When the street lights turned white, everyone started walking except for him. I gave him my shoulder and told him it was safe to walk. I could not help but wonder, “Does he stand there and wait until he can get someone to assist him? How long does it take before he gets help? What if he is blind and mute?” 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
> This product will use supervised learning.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
> We can load data on what the street lights should look like when it’s safe to cross or what the street lights should look like when it’s not. This is an appropriate solution because it uses machine learning to determine if an image with a street light indicates whether it is safe for the user to cross.
