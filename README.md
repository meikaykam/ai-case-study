## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
> Envision Glasses

* When was the company incorporated?
> 2017

* Who are the founders of the company?
> Karthik Mahadevan and Karthik Kannan

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
> Karthik Mahadevan was invited to a school for the blind in India to speak about design. When the students were asked about a problem they could solve, the answer was obvious they wanted to be more independent; they wanted to perform day-to-day activities on their own.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
> Envision is a private company that has received funding through a pre-seed and seed round. In the seed round, they raised 1.5 million euros from seven investors.


## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
> Envision allows the blind and visually impaired to be more independent by using their AI-powered app and smart glasses to access information around them. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
> The blind and visually impaired. There roughly 1 billion people that blind and visually impaired people around the world. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
> Unlike their competitor, like the OrCam, Envision’s smart glasses offer a hands-free and light-weight experience. Rather than using a handheld device to hover over a body of text, the user can tap the side of the smart glasses and prompt it to start scanning text within the camera’s line of sight.

> The user can "Ask Evision" using ChatGPT integration to describe an image taken in real-time; it allows the user to interact with the glasses and ask related questions.

> Envision also launched a new feature “Call an Aira agent”. The user can speak with a live Aira agent - also a company founded for the blind community - if the AI-powered solutions cannot assist with their request. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
> Envision uses technology like image and voice recognition to do the following: Instant Text, Scan Text, Batch Scan, Call an Ally, Call Aira, Describe Scene, Detect Light, Recognise Cash, Detect Colors, Find People, Find Objects, Teach a Face and Explore.


## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
> Envision falls under assistive software technology. Their glasses use machine learning as an assistive tool for the blind and visually impaired.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5-10 years?
> ChatGPT and products like ChatGPT that use large language models, voice recognition, image recognition, and facial recognition. 

* What are the other major companies in this field?
> Some of the major companies in the same field are Orm, NuEyes, AceSight, and IrisVision. They are all assistive smart glasses for the blind and visually impaired. The use case is similar and uses AI to scan and read text in an image. 


## Results

> In 2023, Envision received 1.5 million euros in funding. The company used the funds to scale up and support its users globally.

> How often do their users request an Aira agent? 
> Out of the three Envision Glasses Edition, which one is most popular?  
> What are the top 5 used features?

> Compared to other assistive smart glasses in the market, the cost to purchase Envision smart glasses ranges on the lower end compared to their competitors. Envision’s premium glasses are priced at $3499 while their competitors range between $2950 and $4995.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
> I suggest a street mode feature. The user would select that mode before crossing the street. The glasses will scan the surroundings for street lights and either emit a sound that it is safe to cross the street. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
> The goal of the product is to allow the user to be more independent. One of the biggest challenges I see with blind people is not knowing when to cross the street. I remember crossing a busy street in Chinatown, NY and a blind man was standing at the corner of the street next to me. When the street lights turned white, everyone started walking except for him. I gave him my shoulder and told him it was safe to walk. I could not help but wonder, “Does he stand there and wait until he can get someone to assist him? How long does it take before he gets help? What if he is blind and mute?” 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
> This product will use supervised learning.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
> We can load data on what the street lights should look like when it’s safe to cross or what the street lights should look like when it’s not. This is an appropriate solution because it uses machine learning to determine if an image with a street light indicates whether it is safe for the user to cross.
